# Quora Scrolla
Script for Quora.com, written in plain javaScript to scroll down to the bottom of your answers page, without loading images and the user intro.

It still takes some time depending on your answers, but still better than manually doing it.

For the execution of the script I've used [Firebug's webconsole](http://getfirebug.com/commandline).
